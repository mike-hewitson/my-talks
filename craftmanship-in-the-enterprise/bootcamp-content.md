A MOOC (of relevance and interest) is chosen and studied by the team as a group.

Meet once a week to help each other, and provide motivation.

### Section IV - Seven of something

The team selects one of the following books to study together:
* [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)
* [Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/7web/seven-web-frameworks-in-seven-weeks)

* [Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks)

Shared repo created with the sample code. Each team member chooses one week to own, and they got through the work over two weeks, and check into the repo the corrected code for the week. Once this is done, then the team goes through, one week at a time, meeting once per week to discuss what they learned from the week they just completed.
